        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Fahim Ahamed, I am 16 years old and a junior in high school. Currently I am learning how to code using the Python language in my Programming and Protyping class from which I learned many basic skills in the web development process. Though I have some background knowledge in the field, the whole point of this project is for me to learn a new language other than Python and apply my skills over to create a website. For this I used a course I found on Khan Academy to learn the basics of HTML and CSS to style a webpage. Then for the development of this process, I used outside resources such as YouTube videos and W3Schools to do certain things such as the CSS-based animations.</p>
